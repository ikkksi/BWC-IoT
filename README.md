> **BWC-Cat** â€“ A New Type of Centralized Data Communication Application


## 1 Introduction
> **BWC-Cat** is a core centralized data communication system designed to provide a fully open-source, truly secure, and free communication platform. You can use this platform to set up your own chat room, game server, etc.

- **Fully Open Source**: We firmly believe that transparency is the foundation of trust. All source code of Gray Cat is publicly available, and anyone can review the code and submit their ideas.
- **Self-hosted Servers**: Gray Cat encourages users to set up their own servers according to their needs, which means you can have full control over the security and privacy of your data.
- **High Freedom**: We offer a plugin system that allows you to customize features at will. The plugin system also helps decouple your modules to a high degree.

## 2 Core Concepts
### New-Type Centralized System
> BWC-Cat uses an innovative centralized architecture.

- **Encryption Key**: Each central server has a unique key. As long as you have this key, you can join the corresponding server.

- **Self-hosted Servers**: Users can set up their own servers based on personal or organizational needs. This not only ensures absolute communication security but also prevents third-party interference, while enabling more efficient decision-making.

- **Compared to Traditional Systems**: Traditional centralized systems inevitably face high loads. We have shifted some of the computational tasks to special clients (bot clients).

- **Higher Concurrency**: We use modern `asyncio` rather than preemptive multithreading, which avoids the impact of GIL, and it performs well in terms of performance and resource usage.

#### Note:
###### This is server-side software, not a client.
